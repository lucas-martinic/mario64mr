Mario 64 MR, made from your own Super Mario 64 ROM (US) and put on your headset.

The app (Mario64MR.apk) carries none of Nintendo's game: no data and no code. This tool makes both on your own
computer, from your ROM and from the community's public sources, fetched at pinned revisions:

  the game data    extracted from your ROM with the sm64ex PC port's own tools
                     Mario64MRData/baserom.us.z64      the ROM, for the title screen's music and sounds
                     Mario64MRData/sm64/res/base.zip   sm64ex's resource pack: the textures and the sound banks
  the game code    compiled for the headset with Android's NDK
                     Mario64MRData/native/libsm64game.so   the whole game: sm64ex with Mario 64 MR's changes
                                                           (native/fullgame)
                     Mario64MRData/native/libgoddard.so    the title screen's face: the decomp's Goddard
                                                           (n64decomp/sm64, with native/goddard)
                     Mario64MRData/native/libsm64.so       the title screen's sound (libsm64)

usage:
    python3 install_mario64mr.py "Super Mario 64 (USA).z64"            # makes ./Mario64MRData
    python3 install_mario64mr.py "Super Mario 64 (USA).z64" --push     # ...and adb pushes it to the headset
    python3 install_mario64mr.py "Super Mario 64 (USA).z64" --push --label my-label.png
                                                                       # ...with your own cartridge label
    python3 install_mario64mr.py "Super Mario 64 (USA).z64" --check    # only checks the ROM
    python3 install_mario64mr.py "Super Mario 64 (USA).z64" --push --frame --apk Mario64MR-SteamFrame.apk
                                                                       # ...to a Steam Frame, over Wi-Fi

Needs python3, git, make, patch and a C compiler (macOS: Xcode command line tools; Linux: build-essential;
Windows: WSL). The Android NDK (r27c) is found where Android Studio or Homebrew put it, or downloaded (~700 MB) the
first time. The ROM may be .z64, .v64 or .n64; it must be the unmodified US release (SHA-1 9bef1128...), checked
before anything else: a different region, a ROM hack, a bad dump or a zipped ROM is turned down with the reason.
